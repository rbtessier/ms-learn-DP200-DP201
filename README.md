# ms-learn-DP200-DP201
 my notes for ms learn online modules for Data Engineer path DP200, DP 201
 This is updated to August 2020, this information may be out of date in the future.
 I try to mostly focus on how to do things here and including what seems like important notes. 
 DP 200 and DP 201 seems like there are lots of "how to" questions, so how and when to use things
 will receive priority over other stuff.
 
 
 BEST PRACTICES TO TAKE AWAY
 - use variables in bash when making more than 1 resource in the same resource group as in the Server and elastic pools example it makes it a lot easier to create when working in bash (or Powershell - but I don't know powershell variables)
